This project aims to analyse the labor force from 30 countries using R. In the first part of the project, I've been using descriptive statistics to have a better understanding of the data. Outliers have been removed from the data set. 
Concepts that are exemplified in this project: 

Principal Component Analysis descovering that there are 3 principal components,
Correspondance Analysis , 
Cluster Analysis (I descovered that there are 2 clusters using both the Dendogram and the Silhouette chart foor both standardized data and for principal components.),
K-mean algorithm wich outcome also the fact that in the data set there are 2 classes,
Discriminant Analysis (I used the outliers that we first eliminated as a testing set and the rest of the data as a training set) using Bayesian discriminat 
LDA classifier descvering that 15 observations went to class 1 and 27 went to class 3.
